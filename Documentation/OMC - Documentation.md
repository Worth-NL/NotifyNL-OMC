# 1. Introduction

**OMC (Output Management Component)** is a central point and the common hub of the communication workflow between third parties software such as:

- **Open Notificatie** (API web service)
- **Open Zaak** (API web service)
- **Open Klant** (API web service)
- **Notify NL** (API web service)

## 1.1. Swagger UI

Since the **OMC** project is just an API, it would not have any user friendly graphic representation if used as a standalone RESTful ASP.NET Web API project.

That's why **ASP.NET** projects are usually exposing a UI presentation layer for the convenience of future users (usually developers). To achieve this effect, we are using so called [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/), a standardized **HTML**/**CSS**/**JavaScript**-based suite of tools and assets made to generate visualized API endpoints, API documentation, data models schema, data validation, interaction with user (API responses), and other helpful hints on how to use the certain API.

**Swagger UI** can be accessed just like a regular webpage, or when you are starting your project in your IDE (preferably **Visual Studio**).

**NOTE**: Check the section dedicated to [requests authorization](#swagger-ui-authorization) when using **Swagger UI**.

### 1.1.1. Using web browser

The URL to **Swagger UI** can be recreated in the following way:

- [Protocol*] + [Domain**] + `/swagger/index.html`

For example: https://omc.acc.notifynl.nl/swagger/index.html

\* Usually https
\** Where your **OMC** Web API application is deployed

### 1.1.2. Using IDE (Visual Studio)

Select one of the launch **profiles** to start **Swagger UI** page in your browser (which will be using `/localhost:`).

In `launchSettings.json` file, remember to always have these lines incuded in the launch **profile** you are going to use for running the API with **Swagger UI**:

# 3. Required environment variables

## 3.1. Different configurations

> **OMC API** and related sub-systems (e.g., **Secrets Manager**) are using mix of configurations:

- `appsettings.json` (for public configurations, which are not meant to vary between customers/instances of OMC)

![Invalid base URL - Error](images/appsettings.png)

- `environment variables` (for sensitive configurations and/or customizable per customers/instances of OMC):

\* Copy-paste the *environment variable* name and set the value of respective type like showed in the **Example** column from the above.

**NOTE**: All of the configurations are required and validated whether they are null or empty. If you need to skip some `envionment variable` just use a value containing an empty space `" "`.

### 3.1.1. How to get some of these environment variables

`OMC_AUTHORIZATION_JWT_SECRET` - To be generated from passwords manager. Like other **OMC_AUTHORIZATION_[...]** configurations it's meant to be set by the user.

`USER_AUTHORIZATION_JWT_SECRET` - Like other **USER_AUTHORIZATION_[...]** configurations to be configured and set by the user after logging to OpenZaak API web service.

`USER_API_KEY_NOTIFYNL` - To be generated from "NotifyNL" Admin Portal => **API Integration** section.

`USER_TEMPLATEIDS_SMS_ZAAKCREATE` - All **Template IDs** (SMS and Email) will be generated (and then you can copy-paste them into environment variables) when the user create (one-by-one) new templates from "NotifyNL" Admin Portal => **Templates** section.

## 3.2. Setting environment variables

## 3.3. Using HELM Charts

**NotifyNL** and **OMC** are meant to be used with [HELM Charts](https://helm.sh/) (helping to install them on your machine).

- [NotifyNL HELM Charts (GitHub)](https://github.com/Worth-NL/helm-charts)

- [OMC HELM Charts (GitHub)](https://github.com/Worth-NL/helm-charts/tree/main/notifynl-omc)

# 4. Authorization and authentication

**JSON Web Token (JWT)** can be generated using:

- **SecretsManager.exe** from `CLI` (e.g., `CMD.exe on Windows`. **NOTE:** Do not use `PowerShell`)

- **SecretsManager.dll** from the code (public methods)

> To learn more, read the documentation dedicated to [Secrets Manager](https://github.com/Worth-NL/NotifyNL-OMC/blob/update/Documentation/EventsHandler/Logic/SecretsManager/Readme.md).

- External **https://jwt.io** webpage.

## 4.1. Example of required JSON Web Token (JWT) components

> Knowing all required *environment variables* you can fill these claims manually and generate your own JWT tokens without using **Secrets Manager**. This approach might be helpful if you are using **OMC** API web service only as a Web API service (**Swagger UI**), during testing its functionality from **Postman**, or when using only the **Docker Image**.

### 4.1.1. Header (algorithm + type)

> {
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

### 4.1.2. Payload (claims)

> {
  "client_id": "",
  "user_id": "",
  "user_representation": "",
  "iss": "",
  "aud": "",
  "iat": 0000000000,
  "exp": 0000000000
}

### 4.1.3. Signature (secret)

![JWT Signature](images/jwt_signature.png)

> **NOTE:** To be filled in **https://jwt.io**.

## 4.2. Mapping of JWT claims from environment variables

| JWT claims            | OMC Environment Variables                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `client_id`           | `OMC_AUTHORIZATION_JWT_ISSUER`           |
| `user_id`             | `OMC_AUTHORIZATION_JWT_USERID`           |
| `user_representation` | `OMC_AUTHORIZATION_JWT_USERNAME`         |
| `iss`                 | `OMC_AUTHORIZATION_JWT_ISSUER`           |
| `aud`                 | `OMC_AUTHORIZATION_JWT_AUDIENCE`         |
| `iat`                 | To be filled manually using current time |
| `exp`                 | `OMC_AUTHORIZATION_JWT_EXPIRESINMIN`     |
| `secret`              | `OMC_AUTHORIZATION_JWT_SECRET`           |

> **NOTE:** "iat" and "exp" times requires Unix formats of timestamps.
The Unix timestamp can be generated using [Unix converter](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/).

## 4.3. Using generated JSON Web Token (JWT)

### 4.3.1. Postman

> After generating the JWT token you can copy-paste it in **Postman** to authorize your HTTP requests.

![Postman - Authorization](images/postman_authorization.png)

---
<h3 id="swagger-ui-authorization">4.3.2. Swagger UI</h3>

> If you are using **OMC** **Swagger UI** from browser (graphic interface for **OMC** API web service) then you need to copy the generated token in the following way:

![Swagger UI - Authorization](images/swagger_ui_authorization.png)

And then click "Authorize".

- HTTP Request error
![HTTP Request - Error](images/events_listen_httpRequestError.png)

Something went wrong when calling external API services: OpenZaak, OpenKlant, contactmomenten...

You woull get the following outcome (separated by pipes):
`The first possible error message`* | `Full URL to which request was tried to be send` | `The original JSON response from the called service`**

\*  That interrupted the happy path workflow due to connectivity issues, invalid configuration values, or service being down. Unfortunately, due to complexity of the system, the variety of potential errors is quite broad.

\** **WARNING**: For some mysterious reasons, authors of the third-party software (used in OMC-NotifyNL workflow) decided to communicate back with the user of their API (Application **Public** Interface - through **publicly** accessible **World Wide Web** network) by using one of the local languages. You might need to translate those received _JSON Response_ messages into English.

> **NOTE**: Unfortunately, OMC Development Team cannot provide meaningful guidance how the external services were developed or configured.
